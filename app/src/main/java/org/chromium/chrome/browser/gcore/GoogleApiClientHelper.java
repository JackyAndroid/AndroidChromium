/**
 * Helps managing connections when using {@link GoogleApiClient}.
 *
 * It features:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Connection failure handling: some connection failures can be solved by retrying. In those
 * cases, a few reconnection attempts will be made.</li>
 *
 * <li>Connection and disconnection when Chrome is started/stopped: Once a client is registered,
 * it will be disconnected when Chrome goes in the background, and its connection state restored
 * when Chrome comes back to the foreground. That relies on an {@link ApplicationStateListener}.
 * That disconnection can be delayed, call {@link #setDisconnectionDelay(long)} to configure it.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * It should be used when we want to keep a Client around for extended durations and use it quite
 * often, independently of the current Activity. For intermittent usage, see {@link ConnectedTask}
 * or directly create {@link GoogleApiClient}s. They are already cheap and resilient by design, and
 * can be tied to a specific activity's lifecycle using
 * {@link GoogleApiClient.Builder#enableAutoManage}.
 * </p>
 *
 * Usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // Create a GoogleApiClient as usual
 * GoogleApiClient client = new GoogleApiClient.Builder(context)
 *                                             ...
 *                                             .build();
 *
 * // If further configuration is not needed, you don't need to care about the returned object.
 * GoogleApiClientHelper helper = new GoogleApiClient(client);
 * helper.setDisconnectionDelay(3000);
 *
 * // Use your client as usual.
 * client.connect();
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // If you don't need the client anymore and want to get rid of it, unregister it first. You need
 * // a reference to the GoogleApiClientHelper object for it.
 * helper.disable();
 *
 * // It still has to be disconnected if it's not done already.
 * client.disconnect();
 * }
 * </pre>
