/**
 * This class serves as a simple interface for querying the child account information.
 * It has two methods namely, checkHasChildAccount(...) which is asynchronous and queries the
 * system directly for the information and the synchronous isChildAccount() which asks the native
 * side assuming it has been set correctly already.
 *
 * The former method is used by ForcedSigninProcessor and FirstRunFlowSequencer to detect child
 * accounts since the native side is only activated on signing in.
 * Once signed in by the ForcedSigninProcessor, the ChildAccountInfoFetcher will notify the native
 * side and also takes responsibility for monitoring changes and taking a suitable action.
