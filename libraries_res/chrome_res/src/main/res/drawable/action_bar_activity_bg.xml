<!-- On pre-KitKat devices the window background extends above the action bar
     and is normally hidden behind the status bar, but during window
     transitions, is visible and looks glitchy. As a workaround, we make the top
     50dp of the window background transparent. 50dp is greater than the status
     bar height (to prevent the visual glitch) and less than the status bar +
     action bar height (to ensure the background covers the entire activity). On
     KitKat and later devices, Android clips the window background correctly and
     these shenanigans aren't needed. http://crbug.com/448012 -->
